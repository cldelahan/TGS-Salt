Approach:

Training:

1. Using the masks, create a collection of "highlighted" images-- images with the salt or not-salt left as is and the rest colored black

2. Create a CNN to determine whether the given image is salt or not salt-- train CNN to good accuracy


Testing:

1. Using CV2, detect major edges in the salt picture

2. Using edges, break picture into tinier sub-pictures

3. Pass sub-pictures to CNN above to classify

4. Stitch sub-pictures back together to visualize performance

5. RLE picture and push to excel file
