Libraries:
	OpenCV:
		Canny:
			L2gradient: False (More edges, messier), True (less edges, cleaner)
			apertureSize: 3 (least edges)
			threshold1, 2: ~250, +10 (cleanest AND most captured edges)
			apertureSize: 5 (more edges)
			threshold1, 2: ~3500, +100 (cleanest AND most captured edges)
                        apertureSize: 7 (most edges)
                        threshold1, 2: ~53000, +100 (cleanest AND most captured edges)
		HoughLinesP:
			rho: 1
			theta: pi/180
			threshold: 5-->10 (messy), 15-->20 (most representative view), 25-->30 (few lines)
			minLineLength: 5 (small lines only), 10+ (medium/large lines only)
			maxLineGap: 5-->10 (lines will better fit a curve), 15+ (lines are long and cover most of image)
